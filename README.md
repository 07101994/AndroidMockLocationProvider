AndroidMockLocationProvider
===========================

This is an enhancement of the Mock Location Provider Sample from Android found here.

http://developer.android.com/training/location/location-testing.html

This allows you add JSON files to the assets folder and choose from a list when running the app. Make sure the file name ends in ".json". Simply make a GPX file and convert it JSON (I've done it from here)

GPX Creator: http://www.geoplaner.com/
GPX to JSON format: http://www.utilities-online.info/xmltojson/

It's not a pretty enhacement coding-style wise. I just threw it together as a quick fix and thought it might be useful to someone wanting to test multiple locations.
